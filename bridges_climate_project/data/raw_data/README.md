Due to the limitations for the LTBP: InfoBridge database, data files had to be downloaded in seven seperate files. These files will need to be merged, processed, and cleaned before a complete EDA can be performed.
The files in this folder are the results of the RAW downloads prior to any merging, cleaning, manipulation, etc.
