Original data file ('main_dataset') was obtained from kaggle.com.

Using excel, I removed the columns I was not interested in to narrow the data into the file 'main_dataset_revised'.

Additional data was generated using the python file in the 'step03' folder called 'dataGeneration'.

Note: will probably need to update file paths in this section of the code if trying to repeat creation of the database to suit current pathing needs.
