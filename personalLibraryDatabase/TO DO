I would like to keep working on this.

- Add more functions.
- Fix the errors noted throughout the code.

Currently working on this issue:
- Clean up formating and data.
  - A new main dataset has been created (main_dataset_revised_v2)
  - This data needs to be loaded into the database and tested to check for remaining errors.
