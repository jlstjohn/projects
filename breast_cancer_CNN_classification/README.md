This project was done for COMP4531: Deep Learning course.

Collaborator: Margaret Barker

## Motivation:
Breast cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer related death among women in the United States. Utilizing the Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset from Kaggle, we built a convoluted neural network to recognize and classify breast tissue ultrasound images into three different categories: normal, benign, or malignant. Deep learning models can help with these types of image recognition tasks in healthcare settings by reducing wait time, minimizing human error, and allowing providers to refocus their resources into direct patient care.

## Result:
After handling the imbalanced classes in the dataset, our model was able to obtain 76% accuracy on the test set. This dataset is on small side (less than 800 images total). To further improve model performance, more data is needed or adding augmented data may be beneficial. See paper or jupyter notebook for further details.
