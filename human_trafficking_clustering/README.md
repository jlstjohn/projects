This project was done for COMP4334: Parallel & Distributed Computing course.

## Motivation:
Human trafficking continues to be a growing global problem despite increased international attention and resources. Clustering algorithms are unsupervised machine learning algorithms that ideally put data points into separate groups based on similarity. By finding patterns within victims and survivors of human trafficking, we can potentially find areas that traffickers are using to exploit individuals and work to counteract these threats. 

## Result:
The dataset has a large amount of null (missing) information. This, along with weak silhoutte scores, makes any result found from the KMeans clustering performed to be less dependable. It's possible another clustering algorithm would perform better or that different data preparation methods should be used to account for the vast amounts of unusable data.
