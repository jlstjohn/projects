Obi-Wan Kenobi Quotes

Hello there.

So uncivilized.

Why do I get the feeling that you're going to be the death of me?

Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

I have the high ground!

You were my brother, Anakin! I loved you!

These aren't the droids you're looking for.

You want to go home and rethink your life.

If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

Use the Force, Luke.

Remember, the Force will be with you. Always.

So what I told you was true...from a certain point of view.

You can kill me, but you will never destroy me. It takes strength to resist the dark
side. Only the weak embrace it.

If you define yourself by the power to take life, the desire to dominate, to posses...
then you have nothing.

I will do what I must.

You are a great warrior, Anakin. But your need to prove yourself is your undoing. Until
you overcome it, a Padawan you will still be.
