This project was done for COMP4441: Probability and Statistics 1 course.

Collaborator: Gabriel Barela

Research question: How does the weekly wage affect the cost of building a single design industrial complex for a budgeted construction contract with a suitable workforce located in the United States?

Model Highlights: Analyzed count data with poisson and quasipoisson regression models. Additional analysis performed via ANOVA.

Conclusion: There is a large amount of overdispersion in the data. It is feasible that employee level availability affects weekly wage, however other factors should be taken into consideration when narrowing down location choices for future workforce locations. This analysis allows for identifing top locations to consider.
