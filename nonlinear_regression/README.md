Presentation on Nonlinear regression method(s) with R and how to implement and assess model on a data set. Data set chosen was on running and heart rate data. Variables chosen to check for nonlinear relationships were 'heart_rate' as the response variable and 'time_elapsed' as the predictor variable.

Various nonlinear models were fit to the data and then compared using AIC/BIC criteria.
