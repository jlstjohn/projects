# Projects
Collection of showcase projects from courses while at University of Denver.

Project guidelines were not created by me and should be considered property of University of Denver and their staff. Solutions are mine or collaborations with other students (credited on the projects).

## Current Languages Used/Shown:
Python, R

## Project Descriptions:
- breast_cancer_CNN_classification:
  - Ultrasound images of breast tissue were used to train a custom convoluted neural network (CNN) for an image recognition task. The aim was to properly classify images into one of three cancerous categories: normal, benign, or malignant.
  - Our biggest hurdle in this project was overcoming the imbalance of classes in the dataset. Our final model had an accuracy of 79% on test data. Based on the precision recall curve, the model did well in identifying benign cases, performed moderately in malignant cases, and struggled with normal cases. More data, or possibly augmented data, is needed to increased model performance.
  - This project shows the incredible potential deep learning models have for being used as a diagnostic tool.
- workforcewageeval:
  - Count data for weekly employee wages and size of available employee workforce in the United States were analyzed with poisson and quasipossion regression models to determine suitable locations for building a new single design industrial complex.
  - Data had a large amount of overdispersion, which lead to the conlcusion that while it is feasible that employee level availabilty affects weekly wage, other factors should be considered when considering locations for new industrial complexes.
