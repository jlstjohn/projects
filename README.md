## Project Descriptions:
- workforcewageeval: Count data for weekly employee wages and size of available employee workforce in the United States were analyzed with poisson and quasipossion regression models to determine suitable locations for building a new single design industrial complex. Data had a large amount of overdispersion, which lead to the conlcusion that while it is feasible that employee level availabilty affects weekly wage, other factors should be considered when considering locations for new industrial complexes.
